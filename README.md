# BPlus-Tree

This programming project is to implement an index for fast data retrieval without having to search through every row in a database table.

I have implemented the B+Tree dynamic index structure. It is a balanced tree in which the internal nodes direct the search and leaf nodes contains record pointers to actual data entries. Since the tree structures grows and shrink dynamically, I have handle the logic of split and merge in the code.
